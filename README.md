<h1>Simple Mass Renamer</h1>
Simple tool for doing a mass rename of files and/or folders, renaming just the search term in the name.<br/><br/>

Simply drag the files and folders onto the input area, define what word to search for and what to replace it with.<br/>
It will then look at all files/folders you dragged on and replace the matching text in their names.<br/>
There is a setting to also search sub-directories and whether it should also rename folder names.<br/><br/>

The output log at the bottom is also resizeable if you wish to see more results at once.
